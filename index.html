  <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Since 2019, I have been teaching at various levels and institutions, combining pedagogy with hands-on projects. 
    At <strong>UQAM and Teccart</strong> (Montréal, Canada, 2019–2022), I designed and delivered courses in Software Engineering, Systems Analysis and Design, and Python for Science, enabling students in economics and finance to apply data science to real-world problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I supervised numerous student projects from design to implementation, guiding teams in deploying concrete technical solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Concurrently, I served as a <strong>Data Analytics Mentor</strong> in OpenClassrooms (2020–2023), training professionals from diverse backgrounds in Python, R, SQL, KNIME, Tableau, and Orange, and assisting them in practical projects to transition into data-related careers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2024, as an <strong>Assistant Professor at Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo (IFOAD)</strong>, I have been developing new courses in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, supervising student scientific projects, and contributing to program modernization to better prepare students for current technological challenges.
