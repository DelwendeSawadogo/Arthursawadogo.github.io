  <h2>Research Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of <strong>Naouel Moha (ETS)</strong> and <strong>Tegawende F. Bissyandé (University of Luxembourg)</strong>, focusing on applied machine learning in software engineering and security. Since 2018, my research journey in computer science and artificial intelligence has been built around applied projects and interdisciplinary collaborations. 
    <strong>2018–2019:</strong> As a Research Assistant at <strong>UQAM</strong> (Montréal, Canada), I contributed to practical work in software engineering and Python for science.
    <strong>2019–2020:</strong> As a visiting researcher at SnT(Luxembourg) I investitaged the effectiveness of timely patching detection and vulnerability-introducing patches, working with <strong>Professor Jacques Klein</strong> and <strong>Tegawende F. Bissyandé</strong> to outperforming the state-of-the-art in software vulnerabilities management. 
    <strong>2020–2023:</strong> Mentoring data analytics projects for professionals in Paris (Openclassrooms), using Python, R, MySQL, and Tableau.
    <strong>2023–2024:</strong> During my postdoctoral research at <strong>Université Laval</strong> (Québec, Canada), I conducted applied AI research for market trend forecasting in the livestock sector, integrating multi-source data (zootechnical, genetic, traceability, and pricing) and collaborated with Eric Paquet (ULAVAL) to develop predictive models for sales, prices, and margins. 
    <strong>Since 2024:</strong> As an <strong>Assistant Professor at Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo (IFOAD)</strong>, I continue applied AI research, supervise student scientific projects, and actively contribute to new modeling and analysis approaches.

  <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Since 2019, I have been teaching at various levels and institutions, combining pedagogy with hands-on projects. 
    At <strong>UQAM and Teccart</strong> (Montréal, Canada, 2019–2022), I designed and delivered courses in Software Engineering, Systems Analysis and Design, and Python for Science, enabling students in economics and finance to apply data science to real-world problems. 
    I supervised numerous student projects from design to implementation, guiding teams in deploying concrete technical solutions. 
    Concurrently, I served as a <strong>Data Analytics Mentor</strong> in OpenClassrooms (2020–2023), training professionals from diverse backgrounds in Python, R, SQL, Knime, Tableau, and Orange, and assisting them in practical projects to transition into data-related careers. 
    Since 2024, as an <strong>Assistant Professor at Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo (IFOAD)</strong>, I have been developing new courses in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, supervising student scientific projects, and contributing to program modernization to better prepare students for current technological challenges.
